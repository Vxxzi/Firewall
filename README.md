![sudo apt update](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa6bd63-c52c-4f3e-9a90-aaee1a0a4bf8)

*Ref 1: Execution of "sudo apt update"*

The command sudo apt update updates the package index on the Ubuntu Virtual Machine, ensuring that the system has the latest information on available software packages and their versions from the repositories.



![sudo apt upgrade -y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/493ef5f7-2f8c-4b89-a84c-e9970d2950ba)

*Ref 2: Execution of "sudo apt upgrade -y"*

The command "sudo apt upgrade -y" upgrades all installed packages on the linux system to their latest available versions without prompting for confirmation, ensuring that the system is up to date.



![sudo ufw enable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e218eb9-4a2d-447a-a29f-6bb003fa8257)

*Ref 3: Execution of "sudo ufw enable"*

The command "sudo ufw enable" activates the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on a Linux system, enabling firewall rules to enhance security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.

![sudo multiple rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad7f2650-9fcc-42d5-a1b0-2972d9b3d20a)

*Ref 4: Execution of multiple commands*

- sudo ufw allow ssh: Allows incoming SSH (Secure Shell) connections on port 22, enabling remote access to the system.

- sudo ufw allow http: Permits incoming HTTP traffic on port 80, allowing web traffic to reach web servers hosted on the system.

- sudo ufw allow https: Allows incoming HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) traffic on port 443, enabling secure web traffic to reach the system.

- sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp: Opens port 8080 for TCP traffic, commonly used for alternative web servers or applications.

- sudo ufw allow 1000:2000/tcp: Allows TCP traffic on all ports within the range of 1000 to 2000, enabling connections for various services that may be using these ports.

Each of these commands configures the firewall to accept specific types of traffic, enhancing the system's accessibility while maintaining security.

![sudo ufw status verbose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea54eeb7-8096-4455-bf95-931b9d0b4a5b)

*Ref 5: Execution of "sudo ufw status verbose"*

The command `sudo ufw status verbose` displays the current status of the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), providing detailed information about the active firewall rules, including the specific ports and protocols that are allowed or denied.



![sudo apt install nmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d899ded7-2d1f-4931-ac8e-ade0ca42698d)

*Ref 6: Execution of "sudo apt install nmap"*

The command sudo apt install nmap installs Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool enabling users to discover hosts and services on a network, as well as to assess security vulnerabilities.





![nmap ip address](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f746e876-f44a-4be1-b75f-b09e76671ff5)

*Ref 7: Execution of "nmap -v -A 127.0.0.1"*

The command "nmap -v -A 127.0.0.1" performs a detailed scan on the local host (localhost) with verbose output, enabling service detection, operating system identification, and script scanning to gather comprehensive information about the services running and their configurations on the specified IP address.




![sudo ufw status numbered](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9634e3b7-3f4e-4f61-83cd-929613127771)

*Ref 8: Execution of "sudo ufw status numbered"*

The command "sudo ufw status numbered" displays the current status of the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) with each rule listed alongside a number, making it easier to reference and manage specific rules for modification or deletion.



![sudo ufw delete 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8db5bd6d-59e2-43cc-886c-b2045ef9d366)

*Ref 9: Execution of "sudo ufw delete 2"*

The command `sudo ufw delete 2` removes the firewall rule associated with the specified number (in this case, rule number 2) from the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), effectively updating the firewall configuration by eliminating that particular rule.


![nmap ip address 2 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/040b52f4-7299-4506-92e6-9af7329634bc)

*Ref 10: Execution of " nmap -v -A 10.0.2.15"*


The command nmap -v -A 10.0.2.15 performs a comprehensive scan on the target IP address (10.0.2.15) with verbose output, enabling features such as service detection, operating system identification, and script scanning to gather detailed information about the services and configurations running on that specific host.
